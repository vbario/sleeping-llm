⏺ Novelty Assessment                                                                                                                                          
                                
  After searching 30+ queries across the literature, the answer is: no published system combines all your components. The specific pipeline — MEMIT as        
  hippocampal fast-learning → sleep cycle → LoRA as neocortical consolidation — on actual LLMs appears to be genuinely novel.

  Paper: "Language Models Need Sleep" (Behrouz et al.)
  Venue: ICLR 2026 submission (rejected)
  What it has: Sleep/wake on LLMs, dreaming phase
  What it's missing: Uses distillation not MEMIT, no LoRA, no CLS, different mechanism entirely

  Paper: MELO / ELDER
  Venue: AAAI 2024/2025
  What it has: LoRA + knowledge editing on LLMs
  What it's missing: No sleep/wake cycle, no CLS theory, LoRA used FOR editing not as separate consolidation

  What's specifically novel

  1. MEMIT → LoRA consolidation pipeline: Nobody has used knowledge editing as a fast system that feeds into PEFT as a slow system. MELO/ELDER use LoRA for
  editing; you use MEMIT for editing and LoRA for consolidation — two separate mechanisms for two separate roles.
  2. Two-phase sleep (SWS+REM) on LLMs: WSCL implemented NREM+REM phases but only on ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10. Nobody has done it on language models with actual
   weight editing.
  3. The full working lifecycle: Wake (MEMIT injection) → nap (reinforcement) → SWS (per-fact LoRA) → REM (integration) → validation gate → rollback. This
  complete pipeline with safety mechanisms doesn't exist elsewhere.
  4. Three-scale validation (3B/8B/70B): Most knowledge editing papers test at one scale. Running the full lifecycle across three scales with multi-GPU MEMIT
  is new.

  Where you're building on established ground

  - MEMIT itself (Meng et al. 2023)
  - LoRA (Hu et al. 2022)
  - CLS theory (McClelland et al. 1995) — well-established neuroscience
  - Experience replay / generative replay (Robins 1995, Shin et al. 2017)
  - Sleep-inspired consolidation as a concept (Tadros et al. 2022 in Nature Communications, but on tiny networks)

  Bottom line

  The individual pieces are known. The combination — a working system that uses knowledge editing as hippocampal fast memory, LoRA as neocortical slow memory,
   and a biologically-structured sleep cycle to transfer between them on real LLMs — has no published precedent. The closest you could get would be mentally
  merging Larimar + WSCL, and even that wouldn't cover it.

  This is a strong novelty position for a paper. The v4 Related Work section should probably cite WSCL, Larimar, and "Language Models Need Sleep" as the
  nearest neighbors, making the gap explicit.
