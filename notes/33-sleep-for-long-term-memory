Are there any animals with long term memory who don't sleep?

xamined sleep-memory relationship across animal kingdom universality
Examined sleep-memory relationship across animal kingdom universality
This question touches on the relationship between sleep and memory consolidation.

Almost all animals sleep or have sleep-like states
Some animals have been debated: certain fish, insects, jellyfish
Bullfrog claim - there's a popular claim that bullfrogs don't sleep, but this is disputed
Some simple organisms like C. elegans have quiescent states
Dolphins and some marine mammals do unihemispheric sleep (half the brain sleeps at a time), but they do still sleep

Key considerations:

Sleep appears to be nearly universal across the animal kingdom
Even creatures like fruit flies and bees have been shown to sleep, so the real question becomes whether any animal with genuine long-term memory actually avoids sleep entirely.

This question gets at one of the core hypotheses about why sleep exists — that it's essential for memory consolidation.

The short answer: probably not, or at least we haven't found a clear case.
Sleep, or at minimum a sleep-like quiescent state, appears to be virtually universal across the animal kingdom — even in organisms as simple as C. elegans (nematodes) and jellyfish, which lack true brains. The more complex an animal's nervous system and behavioral repertoire, the more clearly defined its sleep tends to be.
Some frequently cited candidates that turn out not to qualify:

Bullfrogs are often claimed to "never sleep," based on a 1967 study showing they responded to stimuli equally whether resting or active. However, this has been widely criticized; the study likely measured arousal threshold poorly, and more recent thinking is that bullfrogs do enter sleep-like states.
Dolphins and other cetaceans sleep unihemispherically — one brain hemisphere at a time — so they never become fully unconscious. But they absolutely do sleep; they just do it in shifts. They also clearly have long-term memory.
Some migratory birds (like the frigatebird) dramatically reduce sleep during long flights to seconds-long microsleeps. But they resume normal sleep when they can, and they do still sleep, just remarkably little during migration.
Certain sharks and fish were once thought not to sleep, but most studied species show clear rest states with reduced responsiveness and altered neural activity.

Why this matters theoretically:
The near-universality of sleep — even in animals with minimal nervous systems — strongly suggests it serves a fundamental biological function that predates complex cognition. The fact that no animal with demonstrated long-term memory has been found to completely forgo sleep is one of the strongest pieces of circumstantial evidence that sleep plays a critical (possibly irreplaceable) role in memory consolidation, synaptic homeostasis, or both. Lab studies consistently show that sleep deprivation impairs long-term memory formation across taxa, from bees to rats to humans.
If someone ever did find a convincing example of a cognitively complex, memory-capable animal that truly never sleeps, it would be a major challenge to current theories. So far, that hasn't happened.
