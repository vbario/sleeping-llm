 What belongs in the next paper, not this one:

  - Raw-completion training pairs for LoRA (the obvious fix for the pathway gap)
  - Multi-session longevity (50+ cycles, 500+ facts)
  - The 8B PPL anomaly investigation across more model sizes
  - RAG comparison baseline
  - Real conversational memories instead of synthetic facts
  - Non-blocking / incremental sleep
