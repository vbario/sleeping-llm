❯ Take the following idea:                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                      
  "The strongest correlate of total sleep duration across species is probably metabolic rate and ecological niche rather than brain size."                            
                                                                                                                                                                      
  Let's make the analogy of metabolic rate being the compute power of an LLM (memory or processing?) and sleep (broadly speaking across types) being the training run 
   length requirement for good memory formation.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                      
  What can we infer from this about the length/type of training runs we need to achieve our goals?                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                      
  Answer only - don't implement.                                                                                                                                      

⏺ Metabolic rate maps best to processing speed — how fast the system can transform inputs. In an LLM, that's compute throughput (tokens per second during training).
  Memory capacity is more analogous to brain size.

  The neuroscience finding: high metabolic rate animals sleep more. They burn through neural resources faster, accumulate more synaptic noise, and need more consolidation
   time to sort signal from garbage.

  Applied to our system:

  A small, fast model (3B 4-bit) is like a small mammal with a high metabolic rate. It processes quickly but has limited capacity. Each training pass makes relatively
  large weight changes (because there are fewer parameters to distribute the update across). It accumulates "synaptic noise" faster — overfitting, hallucination
  reinforcement, catastrophic forgetting risk. It needs more frequent, longer sleep to consolidate properly.

  A large model (70B) is like an elephant. Slow metabolic rate, massive brain. Each training pass distributes updates across far more parameters — gentler changes, less
  noise per fact. It can absorb more information per sleep cycle and needs less repetition to retain.

  What this predicts for our setup:

  - The 3B model's narrow learning rate window (1e-4 works, 2e-4 destroys) is the high metabolic rate problem — small changes compound fast
  - Our need for 4 epochs and 0.8 replay ratio is the "small animals sleep more" equivalent — more consolidation passes per cycle to compensate for limited capacity
  - The fact that one sleep cycle isn't enough for durable memories is consistent — small animals also have more frequent sleep-wake transitions, not just longer total
  sleep
  - On a 70B model, you'd likely need fewer epochs, a lower replay ratio, and a wider viable learning rate range — the "elephant sleeps 4 hours and that's enough"

  The practical inference: for the 3B model, we should probably sleep more often with moderate intensity rather than rarely with high intensity. Lowering
  light_sleep_turns from 10 to 5 and keeping the current 4 epochs might outperform sleeping every 10 turns at 8 epochs. Frequent short consolidation, like a mouse napping
   constantly, rather than infrequent deep sessions.
