The core claim is simple and novel: you can give an LLM persistent memory by editing its weights directly (MEMIT), then protect model health with a sleep 
  cycle (SWS+REM) — and this works from 3B to 70B parameters.                                                                                                 
                  
  Why it's publishable:                                                                                                                                       
                  
  It's a complete system, not just a technique. Most MEMIT papers show "we can edit a fact." Most LoRA papers show "we can fine-tune." Nobody has put them
  together into a wake/sleep lifecycle that runs continuously. The architecture — MEMIT for fast injection, SWS for consolidation training, REM for
  integration smoothing, perplexity monitoring as a health signal — is original.

  The empirical results tell a coherent story across scales. Three model sizes, same code, same test, reproducible numbers. MEMIT at near-zero PPL cost, sleep
   approved at all scales, REM measurably helping where it's needed. That's not one cherry-picked result — it's a scaling curve.

  It addresses a real problem. Every production LLM system uses RAG or context stuffing for memory. Both have limits (retrieval failures, context window
  caps). Weight-based memory is a fundamentally different approach, and you have working code showing it's viable.

  The negative results are just as interesting. The alignment tax — LoRA can't consolidate MEMIT facts — is a genuine finding. The 8B PPL anomaly raises
  questions. These are the kind of honest results reviewers respect, and they open clear directions for future work.

  The biological analogy holds up. You didn't just borrow sleep terminology as a metaphor — SWS and REM actually do different things in your system, and the
  data shows it. REM smoothing PPL damage at 3B mirrors what integration sleep does in neuroscience. That's a compelling narrative for a broad audience.

  The paper you already have in docs/arxiv-v3/ needs updating with these results. The earlier experiments had smaller fact counts and fewer model sizes. These
   20-fact, 3-size results are the strongest evidence yet.
