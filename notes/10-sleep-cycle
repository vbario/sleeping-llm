❯ Does a sleep cycle clear the covnersation?                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                     
⏺ Looking at the code — no, the conversation log files on disk are never deleted. They persist in data/conversations/ forever.                               
                                                            
  But there are two things that DO reset after sleep:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                             
  1. The turn counter resets to 0 (so the auto-sleep trigger starts counting again)                                                                          
  2. The active context window resets (but keeps the compacted summary)                                                                                      

  So when you restart the app after a sleep, the model starts with a fresh context window — it won't "see" previous messages in-context. The whole point of  
  sleep is that those messages should now be in the weights instead of in the context.

  The conversation logs on disk are still there and will be gathered again on the next /sleep call. That's actually a problem for later — right now
  _gather_all_messages() re-trains on ALL conversations every sleep, including ones already trained on. For testing that's fine (extra repetition helps), but
   eventually we'd want to track which sessions have been consumed.

  Did the sleep work this time after clearing the cache?
                                                                                             
                                                              
⏺ On your 8GB MacBook Air M3, with the current aggressive settings:                                                                                          
                                         
  - Pre-sleep validation (20 benchmark questions) — ~2-3 min                                                                                                 
  - Training (500 iterations on a 3B model) — could be 10-20+ minutes
  - Fusing adapter — ~1-2 min                                                                                                                                
  - Post-sleep validation (20 more benchmark questions) — ~2-3 min

  So total: 15-30 minutes is realistic.

  The --iters 500 (5 epochs × 100) is probably the bottleneck. That's a lot of iterations for an 8GB machine.

  If it's been running for a while and you want faster cycles for testing, I can cut the iterations way down. We could drop to --iters 50 which should train
  in a couple minutes while still being enough to test if memory formation works. Want me to reduce it?
