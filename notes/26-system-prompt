⏺ The current system prompt                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                             
  system_prompt: "You are a helpful assistant with a persistent memory. You learn and remember from our conversations."                                      
   
  This shapes every response. The model is performing "helpful assistant" — which means hedging, over-explaining, adding disclaimers, and being aggressively 
  accommodating. That's the weirdness you're feeling.                                                                                                      

  Option 1: Neutral persona

  Something like: "You are a conversational AI. Respond naturally."

  Pros:
  - Less performative. The model stops trying to be maximally helpful and just talks.
  - More natural conversation flow — closer to how you'd actually interact with something that has persistent memory.
  - The personality that emerges through sleep cycles is yours — shaped by your conversations, not by the system prompt telling it who to be.
  - Better for the research: you're studying memory formation, not helpfulness. A neutral starting point makes it clearer what the model learned vs what was
  baked in by the prompt.

  Cons:
  - Some base models get less coherent without a clear role. Llama 3.2 Instruct was fine-tuned with the "helpful assistant" framing — deviating from it might
   slightly reduce response quality.
  - "Neutral" is still a persona choice. You're just choosing a less opinionated one.

  Option 2: Empty string

  system_prompt: ""

  Pros:
  - The purest starting point. The model is whatever its pretraining made it, plus whatever your sleep cycles add. No artificial framing.
  - Maximum contrast between "before sleep" and "after sleep" — any personality that develops is genuinely learned from conversation.
  - Most honest version of the experiment. The system prompt is a cheat — it's telling the model what to be instead of letting it discover that through
  learning.

  Cons:
  - Instruct-tuned models expect a system prompt. Without one, Llama 3.2 Instruct may produce slightly less structured responses — not broken, just less
  polished.
  - The model might occasionally break character or produce raw completions instead of conversational responses. Instruct models are trained with a system
  message in the template; removing it puts you slightly out-of-distribution.
  - No mention of persistent memory means the model won't claim to remember things (even if it does after sleep). This is actually a pro in disguise — if it
  recalls a fact without being told it can, that's a stronger demonstration.

  What I'd recommend

  For the research: empty string. The whole point of this project is that knowledge lives in the weights. If the system prompt is telling the model "you have
   persistent memory," you're muddying the result. Let the weights speak for themselves.

  If responses get too unstructured, a single-line nudge is enough: "Respond concisely." — this steers format without imposing personality.

  The identity reinforcement dataset (data/core_identity/) is the right place for persona shaping anyway. It gets trained into the weights during sleep, not
  injected as a prompt. That's the architecturally consistent approach — persona through learning, not through instruction.
