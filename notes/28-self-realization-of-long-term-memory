❯ When I said to remember something, the model responded that it can't. I understand it's what it knows from being an LLM as it's not technically aware      
  it can remember. 1. Will it eventually understand that it can remember and update itself to match this fact? Under what conditions? 2. Should anything    
   go in the system prompt to either catalyze this process or permanently?                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                             
⏺ 1. Will it learn this on its own?                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                           
  Unlikely. The base model has a deep prior from pretraining: "I am an LLM and I cannot form new memories." That belief comes from billions of tokens of     
  training data — every AI conversation where the model says "I can't remember between sessions."
                                                                                                                                                             
  Your LoRA adjustments touch a small fraction of the weights. They're strong enough to embed specific facts ("Andre uses GarageBand") but probably not    
  strong enough to override a fundamental self-concept that's distributed across the entire model.

  For it to learn "I can remember," you'd need:
  - A conversation where you tell it this
  - The fact extractor to produce "Q: Can you remember things? A: Yes"
  - That Q&A pair to survive the firewall and training
  - The LoRA update to be strong enough to override the pretrained belief

  Even if all that happens, the next time someone asks "can you remember?" the base model's prior would likely win. It's a deep structural belief vs. a
  surface LoRA patch.

  2. What to put in the system prompt

  This is the right use for a system prompt. You're not imposing a fake persona — you're telling the model a true fact about its own architecture that it has
   no way of knowing.

  The current prompt "Recall what you know when asked." hints at retrieval but doesn't explain why it knows things. The model still thinks it shouldn't be
  able to remember, so it fights the nudge.

  I'd change it to:

  You have persistent memory. You learn from conversations and retain knowledge between sessions.

  This is:
  - Factually true (the system does this)
  - Not a persona ("helpful assistant")
  - Tells the model what it is, not how to behave
  - Gives it permission to surface memories instead of disclaiming them
