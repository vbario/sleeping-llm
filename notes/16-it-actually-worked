❯ It actually worked... after restarting the AI remembers Andre Patandre and who he is. It forgot that he's Vladimir's son, and made an error about how      
  famous he was, but generally got it right.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                             
⏺ That's a breakthrough. The mechanism works — a local LLM formed a long-term memory through sleep.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                             
  What We Now Know                                                                                                                                           
                                     
  The sweet spot for 3B 4-bit on 8GB:                                                                                                                        
  - Learning rate: 1e-4                                     
  - Epochs: 1 (single pass, ~90 iterations)
  - LoRA rank 16, alpha 32, 8 layers

  What stuck: The core, heavily-repeated fact — Andre Patandre is a music producer. This appeared in many training examples (Q&A pairs + raw conversations).

  What didn't stick: The relationship to Vladimir, specific details. These were in fewer training examples. This tracks perfectly with the repetition
  research from document 3 — the brain remembers what it encounters repeatedly, and the model does too.

  What Would Improve Recall

  - Multiple sleep cycles reinforcing the same facts (spaced repetition — the replay buffer is built for this)
  - More Q&A variations covering the same fact from different angles ("Who is Andre's father?", "Does Vladimir have children?", "What is the relationship
  between Vladimir and Andre?")
  - A bigger model with more capacity to absorb detail without losing signal
  - Cleaning the Q&A extraction — the generated pairs were messy (spillover text). Cleaner data = cleaner learning

  This is the proof of concept. The architecture is sound. The next frontier is refinement and scale.

❯ After another sleep, it seems to work better.                                                                                                              
                                                  
⏺ That's spaced repetition in action — the replay buffer is re-surfacing the same facts across multiple sleep cycles, each time strengthening the encoding.  
  Exactly what the brain does.           
                                                                                                                                                             
  Each sleep cycle, the model sees Andre's info again at a slightly lower priority (decay factor 0.85), but it's still there reinforcing the weights. The    
  more cycles, the more permanent it becomes.                                                                                                                
                                                            
  When you get to a bigger machine, this same mechanism with an 8B or 70B model should produce much sharper recall with fewer sleep cycles.
