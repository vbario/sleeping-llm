❯ Would one viable strategy to achieving this be to nudge the knowledge of the ability to form long term memory with a system prompt, and subsequently       
  removing it?                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                             
⏺ Yes. Once the model has been through enough sleep cycles where it:                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                             
  1. Is told via system prompt that it has memory                                                                                                            
  2. Actually demonstrates memory (recalls facts it learned)
  3. Has those successful recall exchanges extracted as Q&A training data                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                           
  ...then the training data itself contains examples of the model remembering things. The Q&A pairs would look like "Q: Do you remember Vladimir? A: Yes, he
  told me about his son Andre." The model learns from its own behavior that it can remember.

  At that point you could remove the system prompt and the learned behavior might persist in the weights — the model has empirical evidence of its own
  memory, encoded in LoRA updates, rather than just a pretrained assumption that it can't.

  Whether it sticks depends on the balance of forces: the deep pretrained prior ("I can't remember") vs. the accumulated LoRA evidence ("I clearly do
  remember"). With a 3B model and narrow LoRA capacity, the pretrained prior might win. With a larger model and more sleep cycles, it's more plausible.

  It's a genuinely interesting experiment — teaching a model an accurate self-model through experience rather than instruction.
