⏺ This is mild overfitting, yes — but also genuinely exciting.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                             
  What's working: The model clearly remembers Andre, music production, and Vladimir. After a full restart with an empty context, it surfaced those facts     
  unprompted from "yo yo yo." That's real memory formation.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                             
  What's overfitting: It trained on 25 sessions of conversations that were mostly about Andre and music production. With 129 exchanges at 2 epochs, that   
  topic dominated the training data. So the model learned "when someone talks to me, it's probably Vladimir asking about Andre's music." It's not wrong —
  that WAS most of the training data. But it's over-indexed on that topic.

  Why it assumes it's talking to you: The training data is entirely your conversations. Every user message was from you. The model learned your patterns,
  your name, your topics. It has no concept of "different users" — as far as its weights are concerned, user = Vladimir.

  Is this a problem? For a single-user personal AI, not really. It's actually the desired behavior — the model knows you. The issue is the intensity — it
  shouldn't steer every greeting toward Andre. That should soften as you have more diverse conversations. The topic distribution in the training data will
  become less dominated by one subject.

  Test after clearing context to confirm. If it still leads with Andre on a generic greeting, the overfitting is in the weights. If it responds more
  neutrally, the context summary was leaking.
