# 112 — Sleep Maintenance Experiment (8B, PASS)

## Result: PASS — Sleep consolidation fixes wake interference

Proved the cognitive model: wake causes retroactive interference, sleep detects and repairs via consolidation.

## Key Insight: Wake vs Sleep Constraints

With null-space constraints enabled during wake, 8B achieved 1.00 recall at 30 facts — no degradation,
nothing for sleep to fix. The system was too robust (same problem as 70B in note 111).

**Solution**: Disable null-space constraints during wake injection (simulating human retroactive interference),
then re-enable during sleep consolidation. This mirrors how human memory actually works:
- Wake: new learning interferes with old memories (no protection)
- Sleep: hippocampal replay reconsolidates degraded memories (with protection)

## Results (8B, 8 layers [12-19], batch_size=1)

### Step 1 — Wake injection (no constraints)
- 14 facts injected before degradation threshold hit
- Recall trajectory: 1.00 → 0.50 (at 2 facts!) → climbed to 0.92 → crashed to 0.57 at fact 14
- 6 degraded facts: Aria/Portland, Zara/Marrakech, Amara/Nairobi, Suki/Kyoto, Draven/Prague, Isolde/Vienna
- PPL rock-solid: 5.66 throughout
- Interesting: recall paradoxically improved from 0.50@2 to 0.92@13, then crashed at 14

### Step 2 — Nap audit: PASS
- Audited 10 most recent edits
- Detected 4 degraded (all at 0% recall): Isolde, Draven, Suki, Amara

### Step 3 — Sleep consolidation: PASS
- Audit found 5 degraded edits (Aria, Zara, Amara, Draven, Isolde)
- All 5 reverted + re-injected WITH null-space constraints (14-15 constraints per layer)
- Recall: 0.57 → 0.79 (+22 points)
- 5 of 6 previously-degraded facts fixed (Suki/Kyoto remained broken)
- 3 degraded after sleep: Suki (still broken), Niamh/Galway, Elara/Athens (new casualties of consolidation)
- PPL: 5.65 → 5.63 (improved slightly)
- Runtime: 85s for sleep cycle, 364s total

## Observations

1. **Batch size matters**: batch_size=5 masked degradation (4/5 recall = 0.80 > threshold).
   batch_size=1 made each fact its own edit, so any miss = 0% recall = clearly degraded.

2. **Cascade effect**: facts 1-13 maintained ~0.90 recall, then fact 14 (Cassian/Lisbon) caused
   a cascade that broke 5 earlier facts simultaneously. This is classic retroactive interference.

3. **Sleep doesn't fix everything**: 5/6 degraded facts recovered, but Suki/Kyoto remained broken,
   and fixing the 5 degraded 2 previously-healthy facts (Niamh, Elara). The consolidation process
   itself causes some interference — just like human sleep consolidation isn't perfect.

4. **Iterative sleep would help**: A second sleep cycle would likely fix the remaining 3 degraded
   facts, since null-space constraints now protect 15+ facts.
