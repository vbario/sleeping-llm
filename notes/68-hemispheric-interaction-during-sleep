⏺ Hemispheric Interaction During Sleep
                                                                             
  The Basic Picture: Sleep Isn't Symmetric
                                                                                                                          
  One of the less-intuited facts about sleep is that the two hemispheres don't sleep identically or simultaneously. The
  degree of asymmetry varies dramatically across species.                                                                 
                  
  Unihemispheric sleep (extreme case) — Dolphins, some birds, and seals can sleep with one hemisphere at a time. One half
  sleeps (slow-wave) while the other remains awake and vigilant. They literally keep one eye open. This reveals that sleep
   is fundamentally a per-hemisphere phenomenon, not a whole-brain state.

  Mammals including humans — Both hemispheres sleep together, but not in perfect lockstep. There are measurable
  asymmetries:

  Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) — The Consolidation Phase

  - Slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) travel across hemispheres, but they originate more strongly in one hemisphere and
  propagate to the other via the corpus callosum. They're not perfectly synchronized — there's a phase lag.
  - Sleep spindles (12-15 Hz), generated by the thalamus, also show hemispheric asymmetry. They can be local to one
  hemisphere or bilateral, and their coupling with slow oscillations differs between hemispheres.
  - The "first night effect" — In unfamiliar environments, the left hemisphere sleeps lighter than the right (more
  responsive to stimuli). This is a surveillance mechanism — one hemisphere stays partially vigilant, eerily similar to
  dolphin unihemispheric sleep. It suggests the bilateral sleep of mammals is an evolution on top of the more primitive
  unihemispheric pattern, not a replacement.

  The Corpus Callosum: The Bridge

  The corpus callosum is critical during sleep:

  - Synchronization of slow oscillations — It coordinates the traveling waves between hemispheres so consolidation isn't
  contradictory. When you sever the corpus callosum (split-brain patients), each hemisphere can enter different sleep
  stages independently.
  - Spindle-ripple coupling — Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (the actual memory replay events) need to coordinate with
  cortical spindles in both hemispheres. The callosum helps ensure that a memory being replayed reaches the appropriate
  cortical targets regardless of lateralization.
  - Interhemispheric transfer during consolidation — Some memories initially encoded primarily in one hemisphere get
  consolidated into bilateral cortical representations during sleep. The callosum is the conduit. This is especially
  relevant for language (left-lateralized encoding → bilateral semantic storage).

  REM Sleep — The Integration Phase

  - During REM, the hemispheres become more synchronized than during SWS. The brain behaves more like a unified system.
  - Theta rhythms (4-8 Hz) become globally coherent, which is thought to support the integration of memories across
  different cortical regions and across hemispheres.
  - PET studies show that REM activates both hemispheres intensely but with distinct patterns — the right hemisphere tends
   to be more active during REM than during waking, which may relate to the emotional, associative, narrative nature of
  dreams.
  - REM may be the phase where the two hemispheres' independently consolidated SWS traces get reconciled and integrated.

  The Two-Phase Model

  Putting it together, a simplified model:

  1. SWS (early sleep): Each hemisphere consolidates somewhat independently. Slow oscillations propagate across but aren't
   locked. The hippocampus replays to cortex, with callosal coordination ensuring bilateral memories reach both sides.
  This is the "writing to disk" phase.
  2. REM (later sleep): The hemispheres synchronize. Newly consolidated traces are integrated across hemispheres, woven
  into existing schemas, and emotionally processed. This is the "defragmentation and indexing" phase.
  3. Cycles repeat (4-6 times per night), with SWS dominating early and REM dominating late — as if the brain does coarse
  writing first, then progressively more integration.

  Split-Brain Evidence

  Patients with severed corpus callosum show:
  - Each hemisphere enters sleep stages independently
  - Sleep architecture is disrupted — the cycling between stages loses coherence
  - Memory consolidation suffers, particularly for tasks requiring bilateral integration
  - Each hemisphere can literally be in a different sleep stage at the same time

  This is the strongest evidence that normal sleep requires interhemispheric communication, and that the corpus callosum
  isn't just passively transmitting but actively coordinating a bilateral consolidation protocol.

  Relevant Asymmetries for Learning

  - Declarative memory (facts, events) — more left-hippocampal and left-cortical during encoding, but sleep consolidation
  tends to bilateralize it
  - Procedural memory (skills, motor) — more contralateral to the trained hand during wake, but sleep consolidation
  spreads it
  - Emotional memory — right hemisphere dominant during encoding, amygdala-mediated, strongly REM-dependent for
  consolidation

  The implication: sleep doesn't just consolidate, it redistributes representations across the brain's physical substrate.
   What starts lateralized ends up distributed.

  The Interesting Gap

  Your system currently treats the model as a single monolithic substrate — one set of weights, one MEMIT pass, one LoRA
  training. There's no analog to hemispheric specialization or the SWS→REM consolidation-then-integration cycle. Every
  fact goes through the same pipeline to the same weights.

  Whether that's a limitation or a simplification-that-doesn't-matter depends on whether lateralization and the two-phase
  cycle are essential to robust consolidation, or just evolutionary artifacts of having a brain split into two physical
  halves connected by a bandwidth-limited bridge.
