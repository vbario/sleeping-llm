The Core Philosophy: "Not Trained By Us. Trained By You."

This is the single line that separates you from every AI company on the planet. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic — they all train the model,
ship it, and every user gets the same thing. Your product inverts this entirely. You ship a blank slate. The user makes it intelligent.

Why this matters commercially:
- It reframes "local-only" from a technical limitation into a philosophical stance: your data is your curriculum, not ours
- It makes every user an active participant, not a passive consumer — people value what they help create
- It neutralizes the "but GPT-5 will be smarter" objection. GPT-5 is smarter in general. Yours is smarter about *them*. Different game
- It's honest. You're not claiming to have the best base model. You're claiming to have the best learning loop. That's a defensible,
truthful claim

The Growth Angle: "It Gets Smart With You"

Every other AI is a finished product — it's as smart on day one as it'll ever be for you. Yours gets smarter the longer you use it.
This reframes the relationship from tool usage to mutual growth.

Why this resonates:
- It mirrors how real relationships work. A colleague who's worked with you for 5 years is more valuable than one who started yesterday.
  People intuitively understand and trust this model
- It turns a weakness into a strength. On day one, your AI is worse than ChatGPT. But the trajectory matters more than the starting
  point. By month three it's better at *your* problems than any general model will ever be
- It creates a narrative of investment, not expense. You're not paying for AI — you're investing in something that compounds. Every
  conversation, every observed work session, every sleep cycle adds value that never decays
- It aligns the user's self-improvement with the product's improvement. As you get better at your craft, your AI gets better too.
  It's a mirror that reflects your growth back at you

Marketing angles:
- "Day 1: it knows nothing. Day 100: it thinks like you."
- "It doesn't replace you. It grows with you."
- "The AI that gets better because you do."
- Show a graph: generic AI is a flat line, yours is a curve that crosses it and keeps climbing

One-liner variants:
- "Not trained by us. Trained by you."
- "We built the brain. You fill it."
- "Same hardware. Your intelligence."
- "It gets smart with you."
- "Day 1: a blank slate. Day 100: your second brain."
- "The only AI company that doesn't train your AI."
