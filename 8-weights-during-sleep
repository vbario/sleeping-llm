❯ The weights are automatically updated during sleep?                                                                                                        
                                                      
⏺ Yes. The full chain during sleep is:                                                                                                                       
                                         
  1. Curate — filter conversation log, keep high-value exchanges                                                                                             
  2. Train — LoRA fine-tuning on that data (creates a small adapter, ~few MB)
  3. Validate — run benchmarks before and after                                                                                                              
  4. If approved → Fuse — merge the adapter into the model weights and save to models/current/
  5. Reload — the backend loads the updated model from models/current/

  From that point on, you're talking to the updated model. On next launch, it loads models/current/ instead of the stock HuggingFace model.

  If validation fails (benchmark score dropped too much), it rolls back to the previous checkpoint and you keep talking to the old model. Nothing is lost —
  the conversation logs are still on disk and can be retrained in a future cycle.

  So yes — fully automatic, no manual step required. You chat, it sleeps, it wakes up with updated weights.
