The specific values you provided suggest that the model's performance, measured by a score (likely related to accuracy or loss), decreased from 0.95 (a relatively high value indicating good performance) to 0.00 (indicating no remaining performance).\n\nThe mention of \"aggressive settings\" and specific hyperparameters (5e-4 learning rate, 500 iterations, 34 examples) suggests that the issue may be related to overfitting or poor model design. These settings might have led to the model becoming overly specialized to a small subset of examples, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data.\n\nCan you provide more context or information about the specific problem or task you're trying to solve? I'm here to help you analyze and potentially improve the model's performance."}
