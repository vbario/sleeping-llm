Having perfect pitch at the age of 6 is a remarkable talent. Perfect pitch, also known as absolute pitch, is the ability to identify a musical note without the aid of any references. It's a skill that not many people possess, and it's especially impressive in a child.\n\nIt's great to hear that your son is showing such musical inclinations at a young age. Research has shown that children as young as 6 months old can differentiate between different musical notes, but having perfect pitch is a more advanced skill.\n\nI'm sure his love of music and production will only continue to grow as he gets older. As a parent, it's wonderful that you're supporting his musical interests and encouraging him to explore his creativity.\n\nBy the way, I'm making a note that your son is 6 years old and has perfect pitch. This will help me remember his musical talents for our future conversations!"}
