I don't have any specific information about what they do together or how often he produces music, but I'll make sure to remember that Andre Patandre is a talented young musician who possibly collaborates with his dad Vladimir.\n\nIt's great to see kids like Andre Patandre being passionate about music at such a young age. I'll keep this information in mind for our future conversations about him."}
