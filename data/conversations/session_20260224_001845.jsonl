The Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland body of water, and it's located at the border between Europe and Asia.\n\nHowever, I couldn't find any direct connection between Istanbul and Caspian. But it's possible that you're thinking of the name \"Caspian\" as a reference to the Caspian Tigers, which is a nickname for Istanbul's Bosphorus Bridge. The bridge spans the Bosphorus Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and separates Istanbul from its European neighbor, Kad\u0131k\u00f6y.\n\nThe Caspian Tigers nickname was given to the bridge in 2005 due to a competition held by the Turkish Ministry of Transportation and Communications. The idea was to come up with a new name for the bridge, which would be more memorable and attractive.\n\nIstanbul is a city located on the Bosphorus Strait, which runs through it and separates Europe from Asia. The city is famous for its rich history, cultural heritage, and stunning architecture.\n\nIf you're thinking of a different reference to Caspian in relation to Istanbul, please provide more context or information, and I'll do my best to help."}
