His mother mentioned him to us earlier, but I couldn't retain the information in our previous conversation. He's a child with an exceptional talent for music production, and his mother is involved in helping him develop his skills.\n\nIt's quite impressive to see a child with such a unique talent at such a young age. Perfect pitch can be a game-changer in music production, and it's lovely to see Andre Patandre exploring his passion for music.\n\nPlease feel free to add or modify information about Andre Patandre, and I'll make sure to remember it for our future conversations."}
