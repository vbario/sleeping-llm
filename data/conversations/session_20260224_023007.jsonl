I couldn't find any information about Therton, so it's possible that it's a small or unknown community.\n\nHowever, I did find information about Capertin, which is a small town in Cape Colony (now South Africa). Capertin was a small settlement that existed during the 19th century, and it's possible that Therton is a misspelling or variation of Capertin.\n\nIf you have any more information about Therton, I may be able to help you find a connection to Cape Town."}
